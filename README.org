* Project Euler, in gforth
Some of them, at least

Spoilers ahead, though all solved problems are in the 100 first (and it's not the hardest of them in particular. Keep in mind, forth is essentially readable assembly!).

** Running
- Step zero: install gforth
- Step one: run =gforth projecteuler.fth=
  To run a specific solution, run the function (e.g. =PE1 .=). All functions leave the answer on the stack
#+begin_src bash
└ ⍥ gforth projecteuler.fth

** Next steps
I plan to make my own forth, of course, using gforth's syntax. These problems will be a good way to test that the implementation is correct
